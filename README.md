# Level-3-Capstone-Project-2

This is the Capstone project 2 on the 3rd level of the Data Science bootcamp through HyperionDev.
The dataframe UsArrests contains data about the crime levels of all the cities in the USA. (https://github.com/JanHof/Level-3-Capstone-Project-2/blob/main/UsArrests.csv)
The city column as the index and murder, assualt, rape and urban population as the columns.
Data Exploration in jupyter notebook: (https://github.com/JanHof/Level-3-Capstone-Project-2/blob/main/Task_1-checkpoint.ipynb)
I initially explored the data and checked for missing values but found no missing values.
I checked the data types and created visualisations of the range values for the respective columns.

Data Visualisation:
I calculated the correlation of the different columns and created a heatmap to visualise the results.
I created a biplot to illustrate the differeces of importance of the various features and the signifcant 
differneces in the standard deviation.
I standardised the data nad created a new biplot which shows the crime level of the different US cities according to the correlation of the column variables.
I used the complete linkage method to plot a dendogram to visualise thet respective clusters in the dataset.
I created a scatter plot to further visualise the 4 distinct clusters of the cities' crime rates.
